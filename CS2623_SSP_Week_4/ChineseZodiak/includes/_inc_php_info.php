                <p>What is PHP? PHP originally stood for "Personal Home Page", it now recursively stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". 
                    PHP is a server-side scripting language that is generally used in web development. PHP code is included in addition to html and css
                    and it helps to provide a move dynamic experience on the Web. PHP is one of the most widely used server-side scripting languages on the web.
                    The most current version of PHP is PHP 7. PHP 7 provides many new features and updates. 
                </p>
                
                <p>PHP was originally decigned by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995. Then in 1997 Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, two developers at the Technion IIT, rewrote 
                   the parser in 1997 and formed the base of what was known then as PHP 3. Then in 1998 PHP 3 was oficially released to the public. Suraski and Gutmans 
                   rewrote the PHP 3â€™s core, producing the Zend Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel. On May 22, 2000, PHP 4, powered 
                   by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released.
                </p>

                <p>PHP is free software that released under the PHP License, which is actually incompatible with the "GNU" or General Public License (GPL) due to the restrictions 
                    on the use of the term "PHP". PHP is installed on over 20 million websites and 1 million web servers. (PHP: 244M sites, 2.1M IP addresses) 
                    <a href="http://php.net/usage.php">PHP Info</a>75% of Web 2.0 sites are built in PHP. PHP is used by 81.7% of all the 
                    websites whose server-side programming language we know.
